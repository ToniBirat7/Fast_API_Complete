    "`FastAPI` is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide high performance, making it a popular choice for building web applications and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is built on top of `Starlette` for the web parts and `Pydantic` for the data parts. `FastAPI` is known for its speed, ease of use, and automatic generation of interactive API documentation.\n",

    "It by default uses `Uvicorn` as the ASGI server. To run the application, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uvicorn app.main:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it provides an interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. It is `Swagger UI` by default. You can also access the alternative documentation at `http://localhost:8000/redoc`, which is `ReDoc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a great support for asynchronous programming and can handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly suitable for building `RESTful APIs`, `GraphQL APIs`, and other web applications that require high performance and scalability. It is also easy to integrate with other libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for web development in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also provides `Type Hints` support, which allows developers to define the expected types of function parameters and return values. This helps to catch errors early in the development process and improves code readability.\n",

    "## **Path and Query Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "In `FastAPI`, we can define path and query parameters in our routes. Path parameters are part of the URL path, while query parameters are appended to the URL after a question mark (`?`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Path**\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters are defined by including them in the route path using curly braces (`{}`). For example, to define a route that accepts a user ID as a path parameter, we can do the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Query**\n",
    "\n",
    "Query parameters are defined by including them as function parameters in the route handler. For example, to define a route that accepts a search query as a query parameter, we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",

    "## **Understanding Pydantic Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pydantic` is a data validation and settings management library for Python, which is used by `FastAPI` to define and validate data models. It allows you to define data structures using Python type annotations, and it automatically validates the data against the defined types.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `Pydantic` models in `FastAPI`, you need to define a class that inherits from `pydantic.BaseModel`. Each attribute of the class represents a field in the data model, and you can specify the type of each field using Python type hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to define and use a `Pydantic` model in a `FastAPI` application:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "class Item(BaseModel):\n",
    "    name: str\n",
    "    description: str = None\n",
    "    price: float\n",
    "    tax: float = None\n",
    "@app.post(\"/items/\")\n",
    "async def create_item(item: Item):\n",
    "    return item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will define a `Schema` for an `Item` that needs to be sent in the request body when creating a new item.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a `Pydantic` model named `Item` with four fields: `name`, `description`, `price`, and `tax`. The `description` and `tax` fields are optional, as indicated by the default value of `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client sends a POST request to the `/items/` endpoint with a JSON payload, `FastAPI` automatically validates the data against the `Item` model. If the data is valid, it is passed to the `create_item` function as an instance of the `Item` class. If the data is invalid, `FastAPI` returns a 422 Unprocessable Entity response with details about the validation errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Request Body:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Sample Item\",\n",
    "  \"description\": \"This is a sample item.\",\n",
    "  \"price\": 19.99,\n",
    "  \"tax\": 1.99\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `Pydantic` models to define request bodies, query parameters, and response models in your `FastAPI` application. This makes it easy to ensure that the data being sent and received by your API is valid and conforms to the expected structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Response Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not limited to `POST` requests, we can also use `Pydantic` models with `GET` request to validate the `Model` data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say, we want to hide some fields from the response. We can create another `Pydantic` model for the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "class User(BaseModel):\n",
    "    id: int\n",
    "    username: str\n",
    "    email: str\n",
    "    full_name: str = None\n",
    "\n",
    "class UserOnly(BaseModel):\n",
    "    id: int\n",
    "    username: str\n",
    "    email: str\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/users/{user_id}\", response_model=UserOnly)\n",
    "async def get_user(user_id: int):\n",
    "    user = User(\n",
    "        id=user_id,\n",
    "        username=\"johndoe\",\n",
    "        email=\"johndoe@example.com\",\n",
    "        full_name=\"John Doe\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    return user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here in the response, only the fields defined in the `UserOnly` model will be returned, effectively hiding the `full_name` field from the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we use `response_model=User`, but return `{'data': user}`, then the response will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"data\": {\n",
    "    \"id\": 1,\n",
    "    \"username\": \"johndoe\",\n",
    "    \"email\": \"johndoe@example.com\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which will not validate against the `User` model, and will raise a validation error.\n",
