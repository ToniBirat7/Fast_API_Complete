    "`FastAPI` is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide high performance, making it a popular choice for building web applications and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is built on top of `Starlette` for the web parts and `Pydantic` for the data parts. `FastAPI` is known for its speed, ease of use, and automatic generation of interactive API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Official_Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/)\n",

    "It by default uses `Uvicorn` as the ASGI server. To run the application, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uvicorn app.main:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it provides an interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. It is `Swagger UI` by default. You can also access the alternative documentation at `http://localhost:8000/redoc`, which is `ReDoc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a great support for asynchronous programming and can handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly suitable for building `RESTful APIs`, `GraphQL APIs`, and other web applications that require high performance and scalability. It is also easy to integrate with other libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for web development in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also provides `Type Hints` support, which allows developers to define the expected types of function parameters and return values. This helps to catch errors early in the development process and improves code readability.\n",
